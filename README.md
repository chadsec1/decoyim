**DecoyIM** (a fork of CoyIM) is a secure, privacy-first XMPP chat client built in Go with a minimalist GTK UI. It defaults to strong, sane security settings‚Äî**OTR encryption**, **Tor routing**, and **TLS validation**‚Äîwith no setup required.

We aim to make encrypted chat accessible and safe, even for high-risk users.

## üö® Security Warning

OTR3 code has been audited; the rest hasn't. Use with caution if you're a high-risk target.

All binary releases are compiled on Github servers, and not our machines. This ensure highest security in event developers are compromised

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building

Requires:
- Go ‚â• 1.19
- GTK+ ‚â• 3.12

### Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev ruby-full
```

### MacOS
```sh
brew install gnome-icon-theme
brew install gtk+3 gtk-mac-integration
```


In order to build DecoyIM, you should check out the source code, and run:

```sh
make deps
make build
```


It might be possible to build DecoyIM using `go get` but we currently do not support this method.

NOTE: If `esc` isn't found after `make deps`, it's likely in `$HOME/go/bin`.  
Run `export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"` to fix it.
